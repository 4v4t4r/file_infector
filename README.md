# file_infector
A pre-appended PE infecting virus that was created during my malware research and development capstone research project. The payload for this is quite weak, just spawns a message box and creates three seemingly random text files, but it can be enhanced if desired; since this was for a class presentation, I didn't want to implement too strong of a payload.
